**Glitch** is a live coding environment, that can use JavaScript to create test projects, as well as leverage Node.js server code.

The example above can be "remixed", meaning forked into your own unique project that can be developed (basic Glitch accounts are free). It has some sample code to take a Zoom App Webhook event and process the request, with the end goal of sending xAPI statements.
